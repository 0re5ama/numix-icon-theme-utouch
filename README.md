Numix uTouch icon theme
=======================

Numix uTouch is an icon theme from the [Numix project](http://numixproject.org). This theme is now being continued by [robocoder-db](https://github.com/robocoder-db)! (Formerly DevilishDB). This is only because the theme still seemed to be popular with the community. Hopefully it will become more popular again now that it's being continued!

Installation
------------

uTouch 3 is not yet available on the Numix PPA (but it hopefully will be soon!). If you still want to use uTouch 2 on Ubuntu or any of it's derivatives (including Mint and elementary OS) you can use the PPA. Fire up a Terminal and run the following:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:numix/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install numix-icon-theme-utouch
```

Icon Requests
-------------

You can request icons by using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-utouch/issues).

Hardcoded Icons
---------------

To deal with hardcoded application icons Numix uses the [hardcode-fixer](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer) script. A list of the applications supported by the script that Numix also covers can be found [here](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer/blob/master/data/themes/numix.md).
