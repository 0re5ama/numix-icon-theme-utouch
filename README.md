Numix uTouch icon theme
=======================

Numix uTouch is an icon theme from the [Numix project](http://numixproject.org). This theme is now being continued by [robocoder-db](https://github.com/robocoder-db)! (A.K.A DevilishDB). This is only because the theme still seemed to be popular with the community, though its popularity has faded over time. Hopefully it will become popular again now that it's being continued.

Installation
------------

uTouch 3 is not yet available on the Numix PPA (but it hopefully will be soon!). If you still want to use uTouch 2 on Ubuntu or any of it's derivatives (including Mint and elementary OS) you can use the PPA. Fire up a Terminal and run the following:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:numix/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install numix-icon-theme-utouch
```

Icon Requests
-------------

You can request icons by using the Numix-Technic [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-technic/issues). These Numix-Technic icons will then later appear in Numix-uTouch, since Technic is the base project. Please include the name of the icon (`icon=...` in the `.desktop` file), the webpage if applicable and the default icon (an image or a link to an image).

Hardcoded Icons
---------------

To deal with hardcoded application icons Numix uses the [hardcode-fixer](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer) script. A list of the applications supported by the script that Numix also covers can be found [here](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer/blob/master/data/themes/numix.md).
