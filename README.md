Numix uTouch is an icon theme from the [Numix project](http://numixproject.org). This theme is no longer maintained so it is reccomended that you use [Numix Circle](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-circle) instead.

### Installation
If you still want to use uTouch ismply download the package on [DeviantArt](http://me4oslav.deviantart.com/art/Numix-uTouch-Linux-Desktop-Icon-Theme-389122876) and follow the instruction.

If you want to use uTouch on Ubuntu or any of it's derivatives (including Mint and elementary OS) you can use our Numix PPA. Fire up a Terminal and run the following:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:numix/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install numix-icon-theme-utouch
```

### Icon Requests
Because Numix uTouch is no longer maintained issue reports beyond major bugs are no longer taken.

### Hardcoded Icons
To deal with hardcoded application icons Numix uses the [hardcode-fixer](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer) script. A list of the applications supported by the script that Numix also covers can be found [here](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer/blob/master/data/themes/numix.md).
